# Home automation Iot
This project aims to create a budget-friendly IoT-based smart home automation system that can be used to cost-effectively convert normal switchboards to smart switchboards with little to no change in the existing home wiring.
Our modules allow the user to connect a maximum of 6 switches at the additional cost of a relay module per switch. This means if the customer has to automate a switchboard consisting of 4 switches, they are only required to buy the control module and 4 relay modules. The relay modules only cost around 10% of the cost of the control module. In the future, if they wish to add 2 more switches, 
they only need to purchase 2 relay modules instead of purchasing additional control modules.
<br/>This device can be easily installed and configured by any user with basic electrical knowledge. Our mobile app allows users to control the devices from anywhere in the world. You can also control the device using Google Home and Google Assistant.
